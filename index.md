## General Shortcuts
- Line navigation
    - Arrow keys 
    - Modifiers
        - `ALT` - move in 'word' increments
        - `CMD` - move in 'line' increments
        - `SHIFT` - selects items 
    - To enable these in ITerm
        - Settings -> Profiles -> Keys -> Key Mappings -> Presets -> Natural Text Editing
- vim bindings
    - I do not use these
    - vim is considerably more effort to learn, but much more powerful
    - If you're interested in giving vim a go, have a look at the vim tutor, just type `vimtutor` into your terminal to access it
    - vim bindings can be used in many places, other than just the vim editor
        - vscode
        - terminal
        - browser
            - [vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)
                - more functionality than link hints, but more complicated
            - [LinkHints](https://lydell.github.io/LinkHints/)
                - click links on the browser using just your keyboard

## VSCode Commands
- There are equivalents for these in XCode too (and probably the majority of editors)
- `CMD + P` 
    - Fuzzy Find 
        - allows you jump to files in the currently open workspace
    - You can also use other vscode go-tos by typing the right symbol here
        - i.e. `>` for command palette commands, `@` for go to symbol
    - Open quickly seems to be the XCode equivalent
- `CMD + SHIFT + O` / `CMD + P` - `@`
    - Jump to symbols in the currently open file, i.e. functions/ interfaces/ classes
- `CMD + T` / `CMD + P` - `#`
    - Jump to symbols in the workspace, i.e. functions/ interfaces/ classes
    - From what I can see, Open quickly in XCode seems to offer this functionality as well as being able to navigate files
- `CMD + SHIFT + P` / `CMD + P` - `>`
    - Able to do lots of things!
    - If it's an action you want to complete within vscode, there is probably a command for it in the command palete
    - Keyboard shortcuts are also shown next to the command within the palette, giving you an easy way to learn the commands you use most
    - VSCode extensions will often include their own command palette commands
    - Examples
        - Controlling git
        - Running tests
        - Folding/ Unfolding code
        - Adding cursors to lines
            - The combination of additional cursors (whether created with the command palette, clicking, or with find/ replace) can be very useful in conjunction with command palette operations
        - Changing the case of text
        - Navigating vscode (i.e. switching to the source control tab)
    - XCode seems to have Quick Actions which works in a similar way
    - It seems like many applications are adopting this workflow more and more, it's worth checking if any application you're using has it, as it's a quick way to speed things up

    - The breadcrumb (at the top of the open file) shows you where the currently open file is located within the open workspace
    - This can be navigated usually by clicking on e.g. the file name to navigate to another file in the same directory
    - For example, if you are in a directory with `forecast.go` and `forecast_test.go`, and you want to navigate to the test file, this is a way of doing that
